# Compatibility and recovery

SQLite schema: 17.

This describes the current source. [Published releases](RELEASES.md) are
recorded separately; a change on develop is not a published download.

## Before upgrading

Close every instance of garret. Make a separate copy of each manuscript's
`.db` together with its adjacent `.pictures` and `.research` folders. Keep
the old application package and a copy of its settings and recovery folder.
Keep encrypted archive recovery keys separately. A database-only copy omits
original pictures and research; a recovery point on the same device does not
protect against losing that device.

## Upgrade and compatibility

For installed builds, close garret and run the new installer or use your package
manager to upgrade. Removal keeps manuscripts, settings and recovery data; it
does not replace a backup. For portable builds, extract into a separate folder,
keeping the interface
files beside the executable or inside the macOS bundle. First open a disposable
copy of a book and check its prose, outline, pictures, research, and exports.
Opening a supported older book can upgrade its SQLite schema. A newer schema
is refused by an older build; do not edit `PRAGMA user_version` to bypass this.
Static version checks do not establish that every legacy book upgrades correctly.

Both 0.0.1 and 0.0.2 use SQLite schema 17. The 0.0.2 DOCX importer adds
archive expansion limits: 128 entries, 128 MiB combined, and 64 MiB per entry.
An oversized foreign document can now be refused. Preserve the original and
split or simplify a copy before retrying; do not bypass the limits. This does
not change the stored manuscript schema or require converting existing books.

The desktop profile now uses `garret` instead of `cc.local.app`, preserving a
compatibility link after migration. Close older versions before first launch.
If migration stops, preserve both folders named in the warning, close garret,
and request recovery help. Do not merge, overwrite, or delete them. The Android
application identifier remains `cc.local.app`; profile migration is not sync.

The desktop application identifier is `com.usegarret.app`. This changes the
Linux menu-entry identity and macOS bundle identity without relocating books,
`settings.json`, recovery copies, or single-instance ownership. Linux keeps its
WebView data in the `garret` profile; Windows keeps its existing WebView2 data
under the local application-data directory's `cc.local.app` folder. Android
explicitly keeps `cc.local.app`, so installing an update preserves its sandbox.

On macOS, the new identifier starts fresh WebKit and HTTP caches, temporary
caches, and native window positions and restore state. The previous native window
positions and restore state do not carry over. Old `cc.local.app` entries in your
home Library and temporary folder are left in place; garret does not move or
delete them. Books and application settings are unaffected: garret keeps its
preferences in the existing `settings.json`, and the desktop interface does not
store writing or settings in WebView localStorage or IndexedDB.
Linux old-to-new book and settings reuse is exercised on disposable data; macOS
and Windows native upgrade behavior still requires testing on those platforms.


On Windows, the uninstaller's optional "Delete the application data" checkbox
removes only `%APPDATA%\com.usegarret.app` and
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.usegarret.app` for the current user. It also clears installer
registry preferences. Neither directory contains books or settings: those remain
under `%APPDATA%\garret` (including its library and recovery files), or in a
folder you selected. The single-instance lock remains under
`%APPDATA%\cc.local.app`, and the pinned WebView2 profile remains under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\cc.local.app`. The checkbox does not remove those folders and
is not applied during an installer upgrade.

## Backup, restore, and rollback

Use a disposable book to verify an encrypted archive with its separately saved
key and restore it as a separate book before relying on the backup. Encryption
protects the portable archive, not the working database, ordinary recovery
copies, readable mirror, or temporary plaintext staging files. Read the
[backup and interrupted-archive instructions](../README.md#keep-a-safe-copy-of-your-book).

There is no automatic schema downgrade. For rollback, close garret, preserve
the upgraded book and profile separately, then use the previous package with
the complete pre-upgrade book copy in a separate location. Changes written
after the backup are not present in that copy. Do not replace a live database
or remove its adjacent originals. If profile compatibility is uncertain, keep
both profiles and ask for recovery help before launching the older package.

For a format or migration change, the change's assessment must identify who
is affected, compatibility with the old build, the backup needed, the upgrade
steps, what rollback restores, and what was actually tested. Existing schema
test exclusions and platform limits still apply; a documentation gate cannot
certify a live upgrade or restore.
